# Architecture Overview

✨ Microservices Architecture.
- Service Granularity: Services are small and perform a single function.
- Decentralized Data Management: Each service typically manages its own database to ensure independence. This is often referred to as "Database per Service."
- Independent Deployment: Services can be developed, deployed, and updated independently without affecting the rest of the application.
- Technology Heterogeneity: Different services can be written in different use different storage technologies, choosing the best tool for the job.
- Inter-Service Communication: Services communicate with each other, usually through lightweight mechanisms like HTTP/REST APIs.
- Resilience: If one service fails, the others can continue to function, making the overall system more fault-tolerant.
